Hi, Iâ€™m Nikolay Klimov (aka @myxo) ðŸ‘‹

My main interests are (without any specific order):
* Low level systems (whatever it means)
* C++ (mostly), go, rust
* Distributed systems, databases internal
* Computer and OS architecture
* Marine industry (5+ years of writing navigational software for ships)

Also I'm a teacher in [Summer school of Young Programmer (rus)](https://ssyp.ru) at Novosibirsk.
